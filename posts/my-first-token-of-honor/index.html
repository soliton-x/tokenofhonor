Those stories are still told in my family. These stories helped shape my understanding of fairness and honor.\nFrom an early age, I was fortunate enough to realize magic was real. Logging onto my computer, playing MMORPGs, exploring the internet—it felt like opening my very own Hogwarts Acceptance Letter.\nIn contrast, the family business was nothing but Number Four, Privet Drive, especially after my grand-father passed away. A place built on inheritance rather than merit, where nepotism overruled all logic. A place where personal growth was always subordinated to someone else’s agenda — ruled by confusion and opacity, where advancement came through personal favor rather than hard work or measurable results.\nBut still, I often asked myself: was there something for me there?\nHaving spent the last 7 years of my life as wizard in Hogwarts, learning magic trick and earning internet money, I thought there was still a world where the Harry Potter and the Dudley of this world could work and build something together.\nI learned the answer the hard way.\nChoosing between what’s right and what’s easy\nA few years ago, during COVID, I decided to start an online business selling artisanal food, manufactured by the family business. Because of the nature of the product, it was highly seasonal — active only two to three months a year — which made it manageable alongside my client work.\nFor practical reasons, I partnered with one of my cousin to handle logistics, while I’d do all the rest. Logistics was indeed a service I could have externalized to a third party company, but I thought it was important to have full control over the customer experience, and optimize the cost.\nSince he was working 8AM-4PM for the family business, it made perfect sense to assign him with work he could be doing as he was already on the ground: a few hours in the morning, a few hours in the evening, for 2-3 months every year.\nFor 50% share in the business, I thought it would incentivize him to give his best.\nIn other words, the deal sounded fair. It sounded balanced. We shook hands on a shared vision I sold him: within three to five seasons, we’d build a strong brand that could eventually run — and sell — on its own.\nThe first season, the business made 3k€.\nThe second season, the business made 25k€.\nThe third season, the business made 55k€.\nBut from the beginning, something felt off.\nThe balance was wrong — in risk-taking, effort, ambition, and real dedication.\nI kept running into excuses, low energy, and broken promises.\nMore than once, I found myself coming down late at night or early in the morning to handle the logistics myself. It was clear that my partner was simply not fully invested.\nLater on, I came to the inevitable realization that this person was simply benefiting from my work and dedication. I was focused on growing a tree that would give fruits season after season. It was only about creating long term value, while delivering short term results.\nI’ll never know if this attitude was of malice, bad faith, greed, stupidity. The only thing I know is that, in life, you can either see the cake as finite, or infinite. A lot of people see the finite cake: they can’t imagine for one second that the cake can grow bigger and bigger. Most of all, they don’t realize they can bake their own cake.\nThere is an entire generation of young people thinking like the mob. For them, you only win something by taking it from someone else. To get what they want, they’re ready to lie, to beg, to ask for favors, to kiss rings. Everything but actual work and sacrifices.\nI was coming from an entrepreneurial background, where you move fast and break things, where you look at data, share feedback, learn on the spot and shoot for the moon.\nI carried a fire in me. I was fighting, pushing forward — while he most of the time moved softly, already acting he’d already won in life.\nI was gambling with my finances and my family’s stability, while he remained safely within the comfort of his routine.\nIn public, I remained quite and discreet about the business itself. In contrast, he spoke the language of winners — the polished rhetoric of a self-made man without the substance behind it. He was basically strutting around, and I never put a stop to it.\nSeason after season — one, two, three — the tension kept building until the clash came.\nOut of disgust, and because I wasn’t truly passionate about the product or industry, I gave him the opportunity to take full control of the company. I proposed to sell my shares, even though, in my mind, I had carried most of the weight that brought the business to where it was.\n6 months passed, nothing came in, not even the beginning of a proposition. I felt like, on top of everything else, I was now wasting my time. I started ruminating dark thoughts, I became ultra-irritable.\nFinally, instead of waiting indefinetely, I came up with 3 offers, all pre-signed by me in advance.\nThe buyout of my shares for 10,000€\nRecovering one’s investment in a single short season of activity — that’s unheard of. Anyone who can do basic math, who isn’t afraid of (hard) work, who knows how to create value — would understand within ten minutes that this proposal was fair and very reasonable.\nThe dissolution of the company\nWhen you start a partnership with someone, if you can’t find a win–win solution when it’s time to part ways, you at least have the courage to end it together. It’s clean, it’s dignified, it shows mutual respect. Like grown men, you shake hands and each go your separate ways to start something new.\nThe buyout of my shares for €0.01\nThe 1 cent proposal: my first token of honor\nSelling my share for 0.01€. One might ask: who in is right mind would even propose, such a deal?\nI know for sure he wouldn’t have proposed me this deal.\nI’m not naive. I know how most people think, I know the vast majority of people would not understand.\nOne might think this was imposed humiliation. But I don’t think of it this way.\nIn my mind, it comes down to the following philosophy of wealth, largely inspired by Ayn Rand.\nMoney is the material expression of a principle: that when people want to do business together, they must give and receive fair value.\nIf you don’t respect this principle, you’re doomed to fail. Only a sick-society, rewarding weakness, can tolerate infringement on this principle.\nMoney is not for freeloaders who demand it through tears, nor for thieves who take it by force.\nLong before freeloaders freeload and thieves steal, money has always been born from the mind and effort of an honest person.\nProposing this deal, I was aware that it would bring me luck, while it would be cursing.\nIndeed, true wealth must be created — you must “make money”. True wealth can’t be seized, begged for, inherited, shared, stolen, or received as a favor.\nThe money I left on the table, by not being paid rightfully, would never again generate anything productive.\nEverything bought with unearned money isn’t a tribute to work, but a reproach — not an achievement, but a shame.\nIt won’t bring happiness.\nNow, who in his right mind would accept such a cursed deal? Who would accept to impose such a trade to another human being?\nTo my kids: never ever be part of an unfair deal. You will be fine paying people what their worth. The value contained in this 0,01€ will always be worth much more than all the gold in the world.\nTo be honest, I received a new last minute offer, a gesture meant to look fair, but it only gave the illusion of integrity.\nThis offer reminded me of dinners where the bill reveals everyone’s true nature: some pay fully, some never pay, and some pretend to — slipping in a small note just to ease their conscience. This was the same kind of pretense. I refused it.\nTo my kids: always pay the full bill, and always be the first to pay. Never split the difference. Never count the pennies.\nYou can probably guess how it ended: we finally settled for €0.01. In his mind, I believe my ex-partner thinks I’m a crazy dude, when I just didn’t want to play hide and seek forever. I have better things to do, my time is counted.\nI wanted to stop the wheel of misery. Cumulitavely, I invested around 6 to 8 months of my life building this side business. I lost, but I learned. I learned that, once you touch magic, there is no come back from Hogwarts. I learned that shared blood doesn’t mean shit. I learned I should have listened to the little voice much earlier in the process.\nMy grandfather was venerated by two generations for having built his business on generosity and integrity. Though he was often betrayed, I like to think he never lost his sense of honor.\nI, too, was looted in my own way — not only of money, but of fairness.\nYet what will always remains is what mattered most to him, and now to me: the quiet dignity of having done the right thing, even when it cost me.\nSomething can’t be bought, can’t be stolen, but must be earned: your honor.\nThis is the story of how I earned my first token of honor, the most valuable thing a man can earn.\n",

It’s also for me, a way to remember what I stand for.</p>
<p>This is the story of how I earned my first token of honor.</p>
<p>I grew up hearing stories of my grandfather’s work ethic, generosity, and repeated betrayals by people he originally helped. Those stories are still told in my family. These stories helped shape my understanding of fairness and honor.</p>

<p>The first season, the business made 3k€.</p>
<p>The second season, the business made 25k€.</p>
<p>The third season, the business made 55k€.</p>
<p>But from the beginning, something felt off.</p>
<p>The balance was wrong — in risk-taking, effort, ambition, and real dedication.</p>
<p>I kept running into excuses, low energy, and broken promises.</p>
<p>More than once, I found myself coming down late at night or early in the morning to handle the logistics myself. It was clear that my partner was simply not fully invested.</p>
<p>Later on, I came to the inevitable realization that this person was simply benefiting from my work and dedication. I was focused on growing a tree that would give fruits season after season. It was only about creating long term value, while delivering short term results.</p>

<p>Selling my share for 0.01€. One might ask: who in is right mind would even propose, such a deal?</p>
<p>I know for sure he wouldn&rsquo;t have proposed me this deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not naive. I know how most people think, I know the vast majority of people would not understand.</p>
<p>One might think this was imposed humiliation. But I don&rsquo;t think of it this way.</p>
<p>In my mind, it comes down to the following philosophy of wealth, largely inspired by Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>Money is the material expression of a principle: that when people want to do business together, they must give and receive fair value.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t respect this principle, you&rsquo;re doomed to fail. Only a sick-society, rewarding weakness, can tolerate infringement on this principle.</p>
<p>Money is not for freeloaders who demand it through tears, nor for thieves who take it by force.</p>
<p>Long before freeloaders freeload and thieves steal, money has always been born from the mind and effort of an honest person.</p>
<p>Proposing this deal, I was aware that it would bring me luck, while it would be cursing.</p>
<p>Indeed, true wealth must be created — you must &ldquo;make money&rdquo;.
True wealth can’t be seized, begged for, inherited, shared, stolen, or received as a favor.</p>
<p>The money I left on the table, by not being paid rightfully, would never again generate anything productive.</p>
<p>Everything bought with unearned money isn’t a tribute to work, but a reproach — not an achievement, but a shame.</p>
<p>It won’t bring happiness.</p>
<p>Now, who in his right mind would accept such a cursed deal? Who would accept to impose such a trade to another human being?</p>
<p>To my kids: never ever be part of an unfair deal. You will be fine paying people what their worth. The value contained in this 0,01€ will always be worth much more than all the gold in the world.</p>
<p>To be honest, I received a new last minute offer, a gesture meant to look fair, but it only gave the illusion of integrity.</p>
<p>This offer reminded me of dinners where the bill reveals everyone’s true nature: some pay fully, some never pay, and some pretend to — slipping in a small note just to ease their conscience. This was the same kind of pretense. I refused it.</p>
<p>To my kids: always pay the full bill, and always be the first to pay. Never split the difference. Never count the pennies.</p>
<p>You can probably guess how it ended: we finally settled for €0.01. In his mind, I believe my ex-partner thinks I&rsquo;m a crazy dude, when I just didn&rsquo;t want to play hide and seek forever. I have better things to do, my time is counted.</p>
<p>I wanted to stop the wheel of misery. Cumulitavely, I invested around 6 to 8 months of my life building this side business. I lost, but I learned.
I learned that, once you touch magic, there is no come back from Hogwarts.
I learned that shared blood doesn&rsquo;t mean shit.
I learned I should have listened to the little voice much earlier in the process.</p>
<p>My grandfather was venerated by two generations for having built his business on generosity and integrity. Though he was often betrayed, I like to think he never lost his sense of honor.</p>
<p>I, too, was looted in my own way — not only of money, but of fairness.</p>
<p>Yet what will always remains is what mattered most to him, and now to me: the quiet dignity of having done the right thing, even when it cost me.</p>
<p><strong>Something can&rsquo;t be bought, can&rsquo;t be stolen, but must be earned: your honor.</strong></p>
<p>This is the story of how I earned my first token of honor, the most valuable thing a man can earn.</p>
