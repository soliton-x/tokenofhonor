I'm known as Soliton on the Internet. 

üìç Paris, France

`A soliton is a wave that's nonlinear, self-reinforcing, strongly stable, propagating freely, at constant velocity even after collisions.`

When I left my country to go live in Paris, I wanted to become a writer. But as it turns out, I spent the last +7 years of my life immersed online, making and growing internet products with a growing focus on (mobile) games and social consumer apps

Some projects I've taken part of or helped along the way: 

- [Blip](https://github.com/bliporg/blip), open-source Roblox for the new-gen
- [Rosebud AI](https://rosebud.ai), generative AI for 2D & 3D game making
- [Zama](https://zama.ai), confidential layer via FHE for *onchain* activities 
- [H Company](https://www.hcompany.ai/), Agentic AI
- [Sush](https://www.sush.app/), virtual pets to raise with your friends
- [SpaceFill](https://spacefill.eu), 3PL logistics with AI
- [LoneRider](https://www.lonerider-motorcycle.com/), Adventure motorcycle touring equipment
