A token of honor is something really rare that you can't buy, nor steal, and that you can't definitely inherit. 

It **must** be earned. 

Writing on this blog is one of my way to earn my own token of honor. 

It all started when I came to the realization that I was on a dangerous slippery slope:

I don't read much anymore.

I don't write much anymore. 

I don't really believe in anything. 

I often feel confuse about the world I'm living in.

I haven't yet found my place under the sun, if such a thing even exists. 

I'm on the verge of being proletarianized. (more on that later)

Today, I'm drawing a line in the sand. Before, there was nothing. Now there is this blog. It will be my go-to place to observe myself & the world(s), by just simply writing what comes to mind. I believe that by observing, noticing, taking a step back, and sharing it all here, I'll earn my first token of honor. 

Here, I'll probably share some stories and lessons, sometimes inspired by my own life. But this place will mostly be used as a braindump. 

The bar will be very low on purpose: the most important thing is that I must write very regurlarly. 

This is a conversation between myself and I, then certainly with my wife and maybe a few friends. 

Hopefully my kids one day.

Maybe it will inspire others to go out and earn their own tokens of honor as well.
