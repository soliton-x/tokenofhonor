## Drawing a line in the sand

A token of honor is something really rare that you can't buy, nor steal, and that you can't definitely inherit. 

It **must** be earned. 

This blog is all about me, sharing about my quest to earn my own token of honor. 

I came to the conclusion that I was on a dangerous slippery slope:

I don't read much anymore. 
I don't write much anymore. 
I don't really believe in anything. 
I feel more and more often confuse about the world I'm living in.
I haven't yet found my place under the sun, if such a thing even exists. 

I'm on the verge of being proletarianized. (more on that later)

Today, I'm drawing a line the sand: this blog is my attempt at observing myself & the world(s), by simply writing what comes to mind. Noticing is the first step. I'll probably share some stories and lessons, sometimes inspired by my own life. 

The bar is purposely very low: I don't expect anyone to come accross this website, nor even actually read it. 
This is a conversation between myself and I, then certainly with my wife and maybe a few friends. 
Hopefully my kids one day.
