This is a complex story to write—and maybe even more difficult to share. If I’m writing it today, it’s for my children, who might one day face similar situations. It’s also for me, a way to remember what I stand for.

This is the story of how I earned my first token of honor.

I grew up hearing stories of my grandfather’s work ethic, generosity, and repeated betrayals by people he originally helped. Those are still told in my family. These stories, though seemingly petty to some, helped shape my understanding of fairness and honor. 

From an early age, I realized magic was real. Logging onto my computer, playing MMORPGs, exploring the internet—it felt like opening my very own Hogwarts Acceptance Letter.

Next to that magic, the family business was nothing but Number Four, Privet Drive.

But still, I often asked myself: was there a place for me there? Can Harry Potter be working alongside Dudley? 

I learned the answer the hard way. 

**Choosing between what's right and what's easy**

A few years ago, during COVID, I decided to start an online business selling artisanal food, originally made by the family business. Because of the nature of the product, it was highly seasonal — active only two to three months a year — which made it manageable alongside my client work. 

For practical reasons, I partnered with someone to handle logistics, while I'd do all the rest.
It sounded fair. It sounded balanced. We shook hands on a shared vision I sold to him: within three to five seasons, we’d build a strong brand that could eventually run — and sell — on its own.

The first season, the business made 3k€.
The second season, the business made 25k€.
The third season, the business made 55k€.

But from the beginning, something felt off.
The balance was wrong — in effort, ambition, and real dedication. 

I kept running into excuses, low energy, and broken promises. More than once, I found myself coming down late at night or early in the morning to handle the logistics myself. It was clear that my partner was simply not fully invested. Later on, I came to the inevitable realization that this person was simply benefiting from my work and dedication without ever acknowledging it. Partly out of malice or bad faith — but also just because it wasn’t something that existed on his mental map. He just couldn't *see* it. 

I carried a fire in me, a quiet revenge against life. I was fighting, pushing forward — while he moved softly, already acting he’d already won in life. 

I was gambling with my finances and my family’s stability, while he remained safely within the comfort of his routine. 

Season after season — one, two, three — the tension kept building until the clash came. 

Out of disgust, and because I wasn’t truly passionate about the product or industry, I chose to let him take full control of the company.

It ended with me proposing to sell my shares, even though, in my mind, I had carried most of the weight that brought the business to where it was. 

6 months passed, nothing came in, not even the beginning of an offer. 

 I came up with 3 offers, all pre-signed by me in advance.

1. The buyout of my shares for 10,000€
   Recovering one’s investment in a single short season of activity — that’s unheard of. 
   Anyone who can do basic math, who isn’t afraid of (hard) work, who knows how to create value — would understand within ten minutes that this proposal was fair and very reasonable.
2. The dissolution of the company
   When you start a partnership with someone, if you can’t find a win–win solution when it’s time to part ways, you at least have the courage to end it together. 
   It’s clean, it’s dignified, it shows mutual respect. Like grown men, you shake hands and each go your separate ways to start something new.
3. The buyout of my shares for €0.01

**1 cent: my first token of honor**
   
Selling my share for 0.01€. Who in is right mind would even propose, such a deal?

This was my signature, and it comes down to the following philosophy of wealth, largely inspired by Ayn Rand.

Money is the material expression of a principle: that when people want to do business together, they must give and receive fair value.

Money is not for freeloaders who demand it through tears, nor for thieves who take it by force. Long before freeloaders freeload and thieves steal, money has always been born from the mind and effort of an honest person.

I was aware that the money I left behind on the table would never again generate anything productive.

True wealth must be created — you must "make money". 
It can’t be seized, begged for, inherited, shared, stolen, or received as a favor. 

Everything bought with unearned money isn’t a tribute to work, but a reproach — not an achievement, but a shame. 

It won’t bring happiness.

Now, who in his right mind would accept such a cursed deal? Who would accept such a trade, where one party doesn't get his fair share? 

At the very deadline we’d set, I received a new last minute offer, a gesture meant to look fair, but it only gave the illusion of integrity. This offer reminded me of dinners where the bill reveals everyone’s true nature: some pay fully, some never pay, and some pretend to — slipping in a small note just to ease their conscience. This was the same kind of pretense. I refused it.

You can probably guess how it ended: we finally settled for €0.01.

My grandfather was venerated by two generations for having built his business on generosity and integrity. Though he was often betrayed, I like to think he never lost his sense of honor. 

I, too, was looted in my own way — not of money, but of fairness. 

Yet what remains is what mattered most to him, and now to me: the quiet dignity of having done the right thing, even when it cost me. Something can't be bought, can't be stolen, but must be earned: your honor.
